### Bonus Conceptual Questions

1. Why is using let safer than var?
    Answer: Using let is safer than var because let is block-scoped, which means it is only accessible within the block it is declared in, reducing the risk of variable collisions.

2. What is the main benefit of separating JavaScript from HTML?
    Answer: The main benefit is that it allows for cleaner, more maintainable code and makes it easier to update or modify either the HTML or JavaScript without affecting the other.

3. Why is Math.random() useful in games or UI effects?

4. What happens if two event listeners are attached to the same element?
    Answer: If two event listeners are attached to the same element, both will be triggered when the event occurs, which can lead to unexpected behavior or conflicts.

5. Why should we use functions to organize code?
    Answer: We should use functions to organize code because they allow for the grouping of related code into reusable blocks, making the code more modular, readable, and maintainable.

### Practical Understanding

1. Why does Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) only go up to 9?
    Answer: Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) only goes up to 9 because Math.floor() rounds down to the nearest integer, and Math.random() generates a number between 0 and 1, so the maximum value multiplied by 10 and then floored is 9.

2. What does addEventListener("click", function(){...}) do?
    Answer: addEventListener("click", function(){...}) attaches a click event listener to an element, executing the specified function when the element is clicked.

3. Why is it helpful to give buttons ids or classes in the DOM?
    Answer: It is helpful to give buttons ids or classes in the DOM because it allows for easy selection and manipulation of the elements using JavaScript or CSS.

4. Can you assign a function to a variable in JavaScript? Why?
    Answer: Yes, you can assign a function to a variable in JavaScript. This is useful for creating function expressions, which can be passed as arguments to other functions or returned from functions.

5. Whatâ€™s the difference between a function declaration and expression?
    Answer: A function declaration is a statement that defines a function, while a function expression is a function that is defined as part of a larger expression, often assigned to a variable.
