            <h2>Feeling Great!</h2>
            <p>Today was absolutely wonderful! I finished my HTML and CSS project ahead of schedule and it turned out better than I expected. My teacher gave me positive feedback, which made me feel proud of my hard work.</p>

            <h2>Just Okay</h2>
            <p>Nothing special happened today. Worked on some coding exercises, had lunch with friends, then studied for a while. The weather was cloudy which matched my neutral mood.</p>

            <h2>Feeling Down</h2>
            <p>Struggled with a difficult JavaScript problem for hours and couldn't solve it. Sometimes learning to code feels overwhelming. Going to take a break and try again tomorrow with fresh eyes.</p>

            <h2>Progress Day!</h2>
            <p>Finally understood how pseudo-elements work in CSS! The ::before and ::after selectors make so much sense now. I implemented them in my project and it looks amazing!</p>

            <h2>Mixed Feelings</h2>
            <p>Partially productive day. Completed half of my assignments but got distracted by social media more than I should have. Tomorrow I'll try to be more focused.</p>
